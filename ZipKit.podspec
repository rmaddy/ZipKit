	ZipKit is an Objective-C framework for reading and writing Zip archives 
	in Mac OS X and iOS apps. It supports the standard PKZip format, files 
	larger than 4GB in size using PKZip's zip64 extensions, optionally, 
	resource forks in a manner compatible with Mac OS X's Archive 
	Utility (in the Mac OS X targets only), and clean interruption so archiving 
	can be cancelled by the invoking object (e.g., a NSOperation or NSThread).
